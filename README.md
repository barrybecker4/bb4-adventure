### [How to Build](https://github.com/barrybecker4/bb4-common/wiki/Building-bb4-Projects)

If you have not already done so, first install [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and [Intellij](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Type 'gradlew build' at the root (or ./gradlew if running in Cygwin).
If you want to open the source in Intellij, then first run 'gradle idea'.
Use gradle tasks to see all the different puzzles that can be run using a command like 'gradle runRedPuzzle'

When there is a new release, versioned artifacts will be published by Barry Becker to [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org).
